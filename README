A WIP tool to quickly generate any boilerplate from a shader

Inspired from [prost-build](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost), and [bevy_easy_compute](https://github.com/AnthonyTornetta/bevy_easy_compute)


Right now this generates the rust code via a liquid template engine; 
but I imagine it would be more portable if we could avoid the need for templating, and we could then avoid putting the templates into the binary

I would like to expand this tool to handle any/every type of shader, 
but right now it really only implements things that I've used in personal projects

WARNING: the build tool assumes that bevy is installed (Could we have a compile time check for this?)
