A WIP tool to quickly generate shader boiler plate for bevy

Inspired from [prost-build](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost), and [bevy_easy_compute](https://github.com/AnthonyTornetta/bevy_easy_compute)

# TODOs Short Term
- [ ] Implement derive macros
    - [ ] shader_data_details
    - [ ] grouped_buffers
- [ ] Implement builder
    - [ ] Handle Entries (Only Compute for now)
    - [ ] Handle Buffers
    - [ ] Generate valid rust file
    - [ ] Insert rust file into the proper directory
    - [ ] Create macro to import generated rust file

# TODOs Medium Term
- [ ] Cleanup the imports to use the more specific ones instead of the entirety of bevy
- [ ] Cleanup re-exports to be be more descriptive

# TODOs Long Term
- [ ] Allow for more dynamic shaders (i.e. Bevy's GOL example where they swap the image buffers)
- [ ] Allow for Custom Shader Nodes
- [ ] Implement some system or other types of shaders (i.e. Vertex and Fragment shaders)
